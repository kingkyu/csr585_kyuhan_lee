# Large Scale Fact Checking Algorithm: From A Network Theory Perspective

This repository contains materials for a large scale fact checking algorithm. The contents of the repository will very likely to expand as the research progresses. Currently, we, in this repository, present related data sets and the implementaion of a base-line model.
